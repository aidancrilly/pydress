# pydress
Directional Relativistic Spectrum Simulator (DRESS) for fusion reactions.

## Installation
Presently, the package is "installed" by simply copying the folder called "dress" into any folder that is convenient (e.g. a folder which is on your PYTHONPATH). Then you modify the file dress/config.py so that the variable `install_dir` contains the full path to this folder. I.e., if you put the "dress" folder into "/foo/bar/pydress" you should set `install_dir = '/foo/bar/pydress'`.

## Documentation
A short Jupyther scrip demonstrating the basic capabilities of the package can be found in the "doc" folder.
